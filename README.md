# eslint-plugin-quasar [WIP]

Currently in development...

When this plugin is ready, it will be moved to the `quasarframework` repository.

## Usage

Add quasar to the plugins section of your .eslintrc configuration file. You can omit the eslint-plugin- prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "quasar"
  ]
}
```
